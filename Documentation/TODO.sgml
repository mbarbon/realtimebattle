<title>To do
<descrip>

<tag>Log-file</tag>
<p> 
The server should be able to make a log-file of the current game.

<tag>Log-file displayer</tag>
<p>
An individual program or an integrated part of RTB that displays log-file.

<tag>Gui-free RTB</tag>
<p>
It should be possible to run RTB without using the Gui. The server writes to a log-file instead (see
above).

<tag>Automatic startup</tag>
<p> 
To simplify running competitions, it should be possible to start tournaments directly from the
command line. An input file will tell which robots and arenas to be used.
 
<tag>Sorting in statistics</tag>
<p> 
To get a better overview, it should be possible to sort the different columns.

<tag>Statistics analyzer</tag>
<p> 
It would be nice to have a separate program which takes the statistical data generated by
RealTimeBattle, analyzes it and shows the result in tables and graphs. Any volunteer?

<tag>Team-mode</tag>
<p> 
In the future it will be possible to compete with teams of robots, not only individual robots. This,
however, requires changes in (or at least addition to) the messaging language, so you will have to
wait for version 2.0 for this feature.
