<title>To do
<descrip>

<tag>A survey of the messaging language</tag>
<p>
Before version 1.0 is release, the messaging language must be definitive. There should be no changes
until 2.0 (in the stable series). The will be an inquiry about proposed changes on the webboard when
v0.9.6 is released.

<tag>Log-file displayer</tag>
<p>
An individual program or an integrated part of RTB that displays log-file.

<tag>Statistics analyzer</tag>
<p> 
It would be nice to have a separate program which takes the statistical data generated by
RealTimeBattle, analyzes it and shows the result in tables and graphs. Any volunteer?

<tag>Team-mode</tag>
<p> 
In the future it will be possible to compete with teams of robots, not only individual robots. This,
however, requires changes in (or at least addition to) the messaging language, so you will have to
wait for version 2.0 for this feature.
