To do
<descrip>

<tag>Generalizing</tag>
As RTB goes into a new developing stage, we will make an effort to
generalize the program, making it possible to run all sort of tournaments.
We will try to maintain backward compability, so your robots won't be
useless in future versions of RTB.
This will come in version 2.0.

<tag>Separation of the Gui from server</tag>
The Gui should be separted making it easier to write other sort of gui:s.
This will make RTB less dependent on Gtk+.

<tag>Statistics analyzer</tag>
<p> 
It would be nice to have a separate program which takes the statistical data generated by
RealTimeBattle, analyzes it and shows the result in tables and graphs. Any volunteer?

<tag>Team-mode</tag> 
<p> 
In the future it will be possible to compete with
teams of robots, not only individual robots. This, however, requires
changes in (or at least addition to) the messaging language, so you will
have to wait for version 2.0 for this feature.

<tag>Networking</tag>
<p>
It should be possible to run robots on separate machines, at least on LANs
and other networks without too much netlag. 

This feature will come in version 2.0.
