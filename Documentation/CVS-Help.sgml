CVS help

<p>
If you want to get the very latest snapshot of RealTimeBattle, you are
advised to 
<url name="checkout the CVS tree from SourceForge"
url="https://www.sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=561">. There you will get more
information on how to use CVS.

<tag>Requirements:</tag> 
<p>

To compile RTB from the cvs you will need <tt>automake</tt>,
<tt>autoconf</tt> and <tt>sgml-tools (version 1.0.x) </tt>. The latter
isn't necessary if you don't need to compile the documentation.

<tag>Compiling:</tag> 
<p>

Before the actual compiliation can be started you need to create the
configure script:
<verb>
% aclocal
% automake
% autoconf</verb>

If everything goes well, you should be able to compile as usual now.

Note that <tt>automake</tt> needs the file 
<url name="gtk.m4" url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle/Download/gtk.m4">
, which isn't installed by default on some systems (e.g. FreeBSD).

<tag>Internationalization</tag>
<p>

To be able to create the *.gmo files you need to have <tt>gettext</tt>,
preferably <tt>gettext 0.10.35</tt> or later (see 
<url name="www.gnu.org" url="www.gnu.org"> to download).
<p>

If you don't want any other language than english, you don't need to
install <tt>gettext</tt>, but you have to configure using
<verb>
% configure --disable-nls</verb>
