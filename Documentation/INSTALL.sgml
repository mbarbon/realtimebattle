<title>Installation

Installing RealTimeBattle should not be too difficult; in case you get problems, please send your
bug report to 
<htmlurl name="realtimebattle@telia.com" url="mailto:realtimebattle@telia.com"> and tell what
went wrong. 

<enum>
<item> Unpack the tar-file
<p>
Move RealTimeBattle.tar.gz to an appropriate directory and type 
<verb>% tar -xzvf RealTimeBattle.tar.gz</verb> or 
if your <tt>tar</tt> cannot uncompress, 
<verb>% gunzip -c RealTimeBattle.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</verb> and 
the file are extracted to the directory <tt>RealTimeBattle</tt>.

<item> Compile
<p>
Before you compile the program, you may want to edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> (see also the install
section below). Only the INSTALLDIR will have effect in the compilation phase, but you can edit the
others as well to prepare for the installation.

Now change directory and compile <verb>% cd RealTimeBattle
% make</verb>

If you would like to debug RealTimeBattle, type instead '<tt>make DEBUG=true</tt>'.

Hopefully everything will compile well. If not, please ensure that <tt>gtk+</tt> is correctly
installed. You can check this by typing <verb>% gtk-config --version</verb>. 

If it doesn't compile as it should, please first look in the makefiles <tt>src/Makefile</tt> and 
<tt>Robots/Makefile</tt>, and read the comments. Maybe you can find a solution there.

If you still have problems, please send a bug-report to 
<htmlurl name="realtimebattle@telia.com" url="mailto:realtimebattle@telia.com">. Don't forget to
describe which system you are using.

<item> Install
<p>
If you want, you can now install the program on your system. Before you
do that, it is a good idea to look at the main <tt>Makefile</tt> and change the install-directories
to whatever you wish.

Note that you normally have to be root to do the installation (unless you change the directories to
be in your home directory).
<verb>% su
# make install
# exit
</verb>

If you like, you can do the installation by hand, in fact, the only important file to move is the
binary <tt>src/RealTimeBattle</tt>, which should be moved to somewhere in your <tt>PATH</tt>.

<item> Test it!
<p>
Type <verb>% RealTimeBattle</verb>

You may have to change the options <tt>Robots search path</tt> and <tt>Arena search path</tt> to
make the program to find your robots and arenas. Read the manual for more details!
