<title>Installation

Installing RealTimeBattle should not be too difficult; in case you get problems, please send your
bug report to 
<htmlurl name="realtimebattle@telia.com" url="mailto:realtimebattle@telia.com"> and tell what
went wrong. 

<enum>
<item> Unpack the tar-file
<p>
Move RealTimeBattle.tar.gz to an appropriate directory and type 
<verb>% tar -xzvf RealTimeBattle.tar.gz</verb> or 
if your <tt>tar</tt> cannot uncompress, 
<verb>% gunzip -c RealTimeBattle.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</verb> and 
the file are extracted to the directory <tt>RealTimeBattle</tt>.

<item> Compile
<p>
Change directory to <tt>RealTimeBattle</tt> and type <verb>% make</verb>

Hopefully will everything compile fine. If not, please ensure that <tt>gtk+</tt> is correctly
installed. You can check this by typing <verb>% gtk-config --version</verb>

<item> Install
<p>
If you want, you install the program on your system, by typing <verb># make install</verb>. Before you
do that, it is a good idea to look at the main <tt>Makefile</tt> and change the install-directories
to whatever you wish.

Note that you normally have to be root to do the installation (unless you change the directories to
be in your home directory).

If you like, you can do the installation by hand, in fact, the only important file to move is the
binary <tt>src/RealTimeBattle</tt>, which should be moved to somewhere in your <tt>PATH</tt>.

<item> Configure
<p>
Before you start, you have to tell the program where to find the robots and the arenas. This is done
by setting two environmental variables, <tt>RTB_ROBOTDIR</tt> and <tt>RTB_ARENADIR</tt>. If you use
<tt>bash</tt> you can e.g. add the following lines to your <tt>.bashrc</tt> file. 
<verb>
export RTB_ROBOTDIR="$HOME/RealTimeBattle/Robots/:$HOME/RealTimeBattle/Testrobots/"
export RTB_ARENADIR="$HOME/RealTimeBattle/Arenas/"
</verb>
You have to enter 
<verb>
% source ~/.bashrc</verb> for 
the change to take effect.

<item> Test it!
<p>
Type <verb>% RealTimeBattle</verb>
