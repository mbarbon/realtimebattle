<tag>Various compilation problems</tag>
<p>
System dependent problems may still be present.
If you encounter such a bug please send a bug report to us.

<tag>Compilation problems with gettext</tag>
<p>
If you encounter a lot of parse errors with gettext and String, try to
configure using:
% ./configure --with-included-gettext
or if it is still a lot of compilation problems, try to configure using:
% ./configure --disable-nls
If it still is problems, please send us a bug report.

<tag>Statistics window doesn't work in gtk+ 1.1</tag>
<p>
Fixed in version 0.9.6.

<tag>Sorting doesn't work for gtk+ 1.0</tag>
<p>
The sort feature is missing in gtk+ 1.0, so this will probably never work.

<tag>I can't resize windows in gtk+ 1.0 </tag>
<p> 
We have still not found a solution to this, but it now works in gtk+ >= 1.1.x.
If you can't resize in gtk+ >= 1.1.x either, you have to upgrade to RTB >= 0.9.7.
