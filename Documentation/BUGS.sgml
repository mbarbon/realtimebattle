<title>BUGS

This is a list of the currently known bugs in this version of the program. If you have found
another bug, please look at the most recent version of 
<url name="this file on the homepage" url="http://realtimebattle.netpedia.net/BUGS.html"> and if you
cannot find it there either, send a bug report to 
<htmlurl name="realtimebattle@telia.com" url="mailto:realtimebattle@telia.com">. Please don't forget

<tag>Various compilation problems</tag>
<p>
System dependent problems are present. We need help with bug-reports to overcome this.

<tag>Statistics window doesn't work in gtk+ 1.1</tag>
<p>
Fixed in version 0.9.6.

<tag>Sorting doesn't work for gtk+ 1.0</tag>
<p>
The sort feature is missing in gtk+ 1.0, so this will probably never work.

<tag>I can't resize windows in gtk+ 1.0 </tag>
<p> 
We have still not found a solution to this, but it now works in gtk+ >= 1.1.x.
If you can't resize in gtk+ >= 1.1.x either, you have to upgrade to RTB 0.9.7.

<tag>Load and Save doesn't work</tag> 
<p> 
It will probable be permissible for robots to load and save for themselves, so these messages will
be removed altogether soon.
