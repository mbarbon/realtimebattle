<tag>Various compilation problems</tag>
<p>
System dependent problems are present. We need help with bug-reports to overcome this.

<tag>Problem when using more robots in the tournament than in the sequence</tag>
<p> 
This should be fixed now.

<tag>Gtk+ 1.1 doesn't work</tag>
<p> 
Currently only the stable version of Gtk+ works (1.0.x), this will hopefully change in the future.
Contributions are welcome.

<tag>Windows resizing</tag>
<p> 
We have some troubles getting the windows work properly when allowing
the windows to shrink. The gtk+ documentation is very sparse, so if anyone can find a
solution please send a patch.

<tag>Load and Save doesn't work</tag> 
<p> 
Please use debug-mode and save to your own files if you want
something stored. This should be fixed soon.
