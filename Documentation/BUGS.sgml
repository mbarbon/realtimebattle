<tag>Various compilation problems</tag>
<p>
System dependent problems are present. We need help with bug-reports to overcome this.

<tag>Statistics window doesn't work in gtk+ 1.1</tag>
<p>
Fixed in version 0.9.6.

<tag>Sorting doesn't work for gtk+ 1.0</tag>
<p>
The sort feature is missing in gtk+ 1.0, so this will probably never work.

<tag>Windows resizing</tag>
<p> 
We have some troubles getting the windows work properly when allowing
the windows to shrink. The gtk+ documentation is very sparse, so if anyone can find a
solution please send a patch.

<tag>Load and Save doesn't work</tag> 
<p> 
It will probable be permissible for robots to load and save for themselves, so these messages will
be removed altogether soon.
