<tag>Windows resizing</tag>
<p> 
We have some troubles getting the windows work properly when allowing
the windows to shrink. The gtk+ documentation is very sparse, so if anyone can find a
solution please send a patch.

<tag>Load and Save doesn't work</tag> 
<p> 
Please use debug-mode and save to your own files if you want
something stored. This should be fixed soon.
