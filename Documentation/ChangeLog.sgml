<title>Change log
<itemize>

<item> <bf>0.9.7:</bf>
<p>

Lots of internal changes, the class hierarchy is completely
redone. Hopefully this will have changed nothing in the behavior of RTB,
expect for the following.

GTK+ is no longer necessary when compiling without graphics.

It is now possible to redirect messages to a file or STDOUT.

Clicking on a robots name in the statistics window now results in showing
statistics for that robot.

Window resizing is working well for gtk 1.1.x and later.

Grab windows is now implemented for gtk 1.1.x and later.

Two new keywords added to the messaging language: DebugLine and 
DebugCircle. These can be used to draw directly to the arena when running
at the highest debug level. 

Everything about loading and saving has been removed. It is now legal to
read and write to files without restriction. Note that it can, however, be
restricted in competitions if the organizer wants to.

A thin line, marking the angle the robot is facing, is now drawn.

'Rotate and Fire' is more or less remade.

<item> <bf>0.9.6:</bf>
<p>
The installation procedure is completely changed. Now <tt>configure</tt> is used to make the program
easier to adjust to different systems (thanks to Martin Norb&auml;ck)

Log files of games can now be generated. The only problem is that they tend to be very large ...

Added sorting in the statistics. Only available with Gtk 1.1.x or later.

It is now possible to clear the message list and view messages from one robot only.

It is now possible to autostart a tournament. See docs to know how to do a tournament file.

It is now possible to choose a statistics file for saving the statistics when autostarting a
tournament.

You can now run RTB without any GUI, either by giving a command line option or by a compilation flag
(gtk+ is still required though).

Added window positions to options.

Bugfixes:

An updating problem with gtk 1.1.x in statistics window was solved.

<tt>Messagetypes.h</tt> is now LGPL'd instead of GPL'd.

Error handling is improved (by removing exception handling).

<item> <bf>0.9.5:</bf>
<p>
The resource-file is now implemented. Please write a <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for your favorite settings.
The easiest way of setting this is to click the <tt>Save as Default</tt> button in the options
window.

Changing of window sizes has been implemented. Change your <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for new default sizes.

The environmental variables <tt>RTB_ROBOTDIR</tt> and <tt>RTB_ARENADIR</tt> are replaced with regular
options. Place your default directories in your <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for permanent options.

Added some buttons to the options window.

Load and Save buttons now uses the gtk file-selector.

The savefile-options is removed

Keyword <tt>Break</tt> is changed to the correct spelling <tt>Brake</tt>.

New robot option: <tt>SIGNAL</tt>, which will replace the old <tt>SEND_SIGNAL</tt>. You can now
specify which signal to be sent.

A new warning message: <tt>OBSOLETE_KEYWORD</tt>. Please replace all the obsolete keywords with the
corresponding new version as soon as possible, since obsolete keyword will be completely removed
within a number of releases and certainly before 1.0.

Long command line options are now available.

The Message output is changed into a clist and new messages are put at the top of the
list. Hopefully this is more readable.

Bugfixes:

Fixes for floating point problems in BSD (thanks to Dennis Cartier).

Recent Linux kernels seems to block <tt>SIGUSR1</tt>, this was fixed by a patch from Oliver 
Jowett. This bug applies to a lot of robots around, so be sure to add the corresponding code to your
robot!

No scrollbars were appearing in the clists when using Gtk+ 1.1.x. This is now fixed.

And a lot of smaller bugs, which I am too lazy to write down (thanks to various people).

<item> <bf>0.9.4:</bf>
<p>
More bugfixes:

 It should be working alright with Gtk+ 1.1.x now and
 problems with the environmental-variables are fixed.

And this time also some improvements:

 Enhanced debug-mode, you can now change debug-levels, kill specified robots or the current
game. Thanks to Ward & Pieter for the ideas.

 When a rotation has finished, the robot will now get a message if it wishes. Thanks to Artur
Adib for the suggestion.

 The included robots are no longer GPL'd, they have no license at all now! Feel free to
(ab)use as you wish, but don't blame us if there is a problem :-)

<item> <bf>0.9.3:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed more bugs. Thanks to Ronan Heffernan, Oliver Kurth, Adam C Luter and Bj&ouml;rn again.

<item> <bf>0.9.2:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed some bugs. Thanks to Bj&ouml;rn Augustsson for a detatiled bug-report. 

<item> <bf>0.9.1:</bf> 
<p>
This is the first ever public release of RealTimeBattle. Even though its the first, it should be
pretty stable and regarded as an alpha release of the forthcoming version 1.0. 
Please report any bugs you encounter. Especially if you have problem with the
messaging language, it has to be changed before version 1.0 is released, since thereafter the
messaging language is fixed and may not be altered (until version 2.0).
