Changing of Windowsizes has been implemented. Change your .rtbrc for new default sizes.

<item> <bf>0.9.4:</bf>
<p>
More bugfixes:

 It should be working alright with Gtk+ 1.1.x now and
 problems with the environmental-variables are fixed.

And this time also some improvements:

 Enhanced debug-mode, you can now change debug-levels, kill specified robots or the current
game. Thanks to Ward & Pieter for the ideas.

 When a rotation has finished, the robot will now get a message if it wishes. Thanks to Artur
Adib for the suggestion.

 The included robots are no longer GPL'd, they have no license at all now! Feel free to
(ab)use as you wish, but don't blame us if there is a problem :-)

<item> <bf>0.9.3:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed more bugs. Thanks to Ronan Heffernan, Oliver Kurth, Adam C Luter and Bj&ouml;rn again.

<item> <bf>0.9.2:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed some bugs. Thanks to Bj&ouml;rn Augustsson for a detatiled bug-report. 

<item> <bf>0.9.1:</bf> 
<p>
This is the first ever public release of RealTimeBattle. Even though its the first, it should be
pretty stable and regarded as an alpha release of the forthcoming version 1.0. 
Please report any bugs you encounter. Especially if you have problem with the
messaging language, it has to be changed before version 1.0 is released, since thereafter the
messaging language is fixed and may not be altered (until version 2.0).
