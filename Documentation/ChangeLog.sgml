<item> <bf>0.9.1:</bf> 
<p>
This is the first ever public release of RealTimeBattle. Even though its the first, it should be
pretty stable and regarded as an alpha release of the forthcoming version 1.0. 
Please report any bugs you encounter. Especially if you have problem with the
messaging language, it has to be changed before version 1.0 is released, since thereafter the
messaging language is fixed and may not be altered (until version 2.0).
