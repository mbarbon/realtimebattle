If your messages are not recognized at all, the problem may be that the STDOUT needs to be
flushed. In C++ this is done automatically by sending <tt>endl</tt> to <tt>cout</tt>, but in other
languages you have to do it explicitly.

Another common mistake is to forget whitespace between the arguments of a message. This problem can be hard
to find since the warning message is usually sent too late or not at all.

<tag> I get error-messages when I try to replay a logfile made in
RealTimeBattle-0.9.7</tag>
This is due to the fact that the there was an error in the logfile-generator in
RealTimeBattle-0.9.7, thus alla logfiles from versions before 0.9.8 is incompatible
with the replay function.
