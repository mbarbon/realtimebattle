<tag>The program doesn't compile on my computer</tag> 
<p>
Well, it is not stable yet, so there may be problems around. Please read the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file
carefully, and study the 
<url name="BUGS" url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle/Documentation/BUGS.html"> file.

<tag>My robot doesn't work as I expect</tag>
<p>
If your messages are not recognized at all, the problem may be that the STDOUT needs to be
flushed. In C++ this is done automatically by sending <tt>endl</tt> to <tt>cout</tt>, but in other
languages you have to do it explicitly.

Another common mistake is to forget whitespace between the arguments of a
message. This problem can be hard to find since the warning message is usually sent
too late or not at all. 

<tag>I can't replay a logfile made with RealTimeBattle-0.9.7</tag>
<p>
This is due to the fact that there were errors in the logfile-generator in
RealTimeBattle-0.9.7, thus alla logfiles from versions before 0.9.8 are incompatible
with the replay function.

<tag>How do I change the language in RealTimeBattle?</tag>
<p>
This is very simple. Just set the environmental variable LANG to your
language. In bash for example, use this:
<verb>% export LANG=en_US</verb>
Note that en_US is to be replaced with the language code that you want to use.

<tag>Which languages is available for RealTimeBattle?</tag>
<p>
There are at this moment four translations apart from english:
Polish, Portuguese, German and Swedish.
