If your messages are not recognized at all, the problem may be that the STDOUT needs to be
flushed. In C++ this is done automatically by sending <tt>endl</tt> to <tt>cout</tt>, but in other
languages you have to do it explicitly.

Another common mistake is to forget whitespace between the arguments of a message. This problem can be hard
to find since the warning message is usually sent too late or not at all.
